     Added buttons for highlighting strings, this way the highlight is not lost if the user has to scroll the page. Removing highlights is also done via button. Added scroll option to form, so it is more compact on the screen. Added vote up and down buttons. Fixed the plugin looks and feels a bit. Fixed a fex bugs I have found all around the plugin. Added usage guidelines to the plugin. The selected language is now saved in a cookie so the user has to select the language only once per session.

     Changed the autoinstall-added new table, changed sql files for creating new table. The new table will hold all the array elements from the language files where the strings are striped from all HTML and PHP tags/variables. Changed the JS file to access new php scripts and display such striped strings to the user for translation
